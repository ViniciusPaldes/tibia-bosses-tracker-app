# Tibia Boss Tracker (Mobile App)

A mobile companion app for Tibia players to track boss spawn chances in real-time, mark sightings, and plan checks â€” powered by my existing backend and community-driven data.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Tibia Boss Tracker helps players stay ahead by showing **high/low spawn chances** for bosses in their world and letting them quickly mark which bosses theyâ€™ve checked.  
This project extends my existing **web version** into a mobile experience with **React Native + Expo**, optimized for speed, offline access, and **push notifications**.

Iâ€™m also using this build as a **public AI-assisted development case study** â€” showing how AI tools can speed up mobile app creation from planning to App Store release.

## âœ¨ Features (MVP)

- ðŸ“œ **Boss List** â€” sorted by spawn chance  
- âœ… **Mark as Watched** â€” synced to backend  
- ðŸ“Š **Chance Levels** â€” high/medium/low based on world data  
- ðŸ”” **Push Notifications** â€” alerts for high-chance bosses  
- ðŸ“¶ **Offline Mode** â€” last fetched data available without internet  
- ðŸš€ **Expo OTA Updates** â€” weekly feature/content updates without full app store review

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **React Native (Expo SDK 53)**  
- **Expo OTA Updates**  
- **Push Notifications**  
- **REST API** (existing Tibia boss tracker backend)  
- **AsyncStorage** for offline data  
- **AI-powered workflow** for planning, scaffolding, and documentation

## ðŸ§© Roadmap

See [ROADMAP.md](./docs/planning/ROADMAP.md) for features and release milestones.

## ðŸŽ¨ Wireframe Design Notes

This projectâ€™s UI/UX planning went through three AI-assisted wireframe iterations, from initial layouts to onboarding flows and final MVP reference screens.

ðŸ“„ You can read the full documentation of this process here:  
[**Wireframe Design Notes**](./docs/design/mid/WIREFRAME-DESIGN-NOTES.md)

## ðŸŽ¨ High-Fidelity Design Exploration

As part of this project, we explored how far we could push **ChatGPT + image generation** to create **high-fidelity static prototypes** without relying on traditional tools like Figma.

This process involved:
1. **Prompt creation** â€“ Using ChatGPT to write detailed prompts for each screen.
2. **Prompt refinement** â€“ Adjusting and improving prompts to ensure clarity and consistency.
3. **Image generation** â€“ Asking ChatGPT to produce the final high-fidelity static images.

These designs:
- Serve as **visual references** for implementation.
- Maintain a **fantasy-themed style** consistent with the app concept.
- Are **not editable design files**, but static images to guide development.

## ðŸŽ¨ Style Guide

We have created a **fantasy-themed mobile app style guide** for the Tibia Boss Tracker project, available here:  
[ðŸ“„ View Style Guide](./docs/design/style-guide.md)  

This style guide defines the **color palette**, **typography**, **layout rules**, **UI components**, and **iconography** to ensure consistent design throughout development.  
It will be used in the **next steps of development** to create the actual theme and component files for the Expo (React Native) project, applying the defined values directly in code.
