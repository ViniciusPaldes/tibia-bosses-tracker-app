# Tibia Boss Tracker (Mobile App)

> A mobile companion app for Tibia players to track boss spawn chances in real-time, mark sightings, and plan checks â€” powered by my existing backend and community-driven data.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Tibia Boss Tracker helps players stay ahead by showing **high/low spawn chances** for bosses in their world and letting them quickly mark which bosses theyâ€™ve checked.  
This project extends my existing **web version** into a mobile experience with **React Native + Expo**, optimized for speed, offline access, and **push notifications**.

Iâ€™m also using this build as a **public AI-assisted development case study** â€” showing how AI tools can speed up mobile app creation from planning to App Store release.

## âœ¨ Features (MVP)

- ðŸ“œ **Boss List** â€” sorted by spawn chance  
- âœ… **Mark as Watched** â€” synced to backend  
- ðŸ“Š **Chance Levels** â€” high/medium/low based on world data  
- ðŸ”” **Push Notifications** â€” alerts for high-chance bosses  
- ðŸ“¶ **Offline Mode** â€” last fetched data available without internet  
- ðŸš€ **Expo OTA Updates** â€” weekly feature/content updates without full app store review

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **React Native (Expo SDK 53)**  
- **Expo OTA Updates**  
- **Push Notifications**  
- **REST API** (existing Tibia boss tracker backend)  
- **AsyncStorage** for offline data  
- **AI-powered workflow** for planning, scaffolding, and documentation

## ðŸ§© Roadmap

See [ROADMAP.md](./docs/planning/ROADMAP.md) for features and release milestones.

## ðŸŽ¨ Wireframe Design Notes

This projectâ€™s UI/UX planning went through three AI-assisted wireframe iterations, from initial layouts to onboarding flows and final MVP reference screens.
